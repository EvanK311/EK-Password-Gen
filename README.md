# EK-Password-Gen
basic password generator

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a basic password generator. 

The purpose of this generator is to create a randomized series of numbers based off of the user's selected preferences.

The user will determine the preferences by first selecting a password length. The length of the password must be between 8 and 128 characters for security reasons.

The generator enforces the restrictions of maintaining that a password will only be created if the requested password length meets these conditions.

The user will select further variables of the randomized password by answering the series of prompts, clicking 'OK' to use this type of character and 'Cancel' to not use this type of character.

The generation process will not proceed if the user does not select at least one type of variable to use in the password. 

Once the prompt and commands complete, a password with the desired length and characteristics will display in the center of the screen; ready to be copied to clipboard for use.
